## THIS MOD IS NOT AND UNABLE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY - WILL BE ABANDONED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE - DO NOT DOWNLOAD (APRIL 6, 2024)

**This mod is made for use with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A. modpack. Use with any other modpack will not be supported.**

## Description

This mod both fixes issues that GAMMA faces with player modding, while also giving players some freedom within their playthroughs. All settings can be controlled in the MCM options in-game.

**FIXES**

*By default with no settings changed*, this will make sure that any armor, headgear, or weapon is not able to be sold, and it will also hide any of the former item types if found in a trader's inventory.

This fixes the problem that arises for GAMMA users who add in new weapons. New weapons are not listed in GAMMA's trader presets, and some mods make use of Trader Autoinject to give traders these items. This alleviates that.
*This also means modded weapon makers will no longer have to make a bunch of DLTX files or make a GAMMA patch for their weapons (outside of maybe balancing their weapon's damage values for GAMMA).*

**PLAYER OPTIONS**

Users who want to sell armor, headgear, or weapons will have the option to through MCM settings (mechanics, suppliers, and trashers ONLY - Nimble is included):

- Are you using vanilla GAMMA Economy? - will turn on/off weapon and armor "hiding" for vendors
- Allow selling armor/headgear?
- Allow selling weapons?
- Min. condition threshold to sell the above? - Weapons with parts need to have all weapon parts and be above the "Sale parts condition minimum" setting in Weapon Parts Overhaul's MCM settings
- Compatibility for SIGMUND Underhaul - Weapon parts will use SIGMUND's "Maintenance threshold" setting instead of WPO's setting

Prices are decided by default conditional calculations, so setting your condition threshold lower won't net you good money earlier.
